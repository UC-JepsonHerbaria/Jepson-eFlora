# Jepson-eFlora Synonymy Files

These are the text files that correct names to those recognized by the CCH, Jepson eFlora, and ICPN.
Whenever either of these three databases are refreshed, new or misspelled names are kicked out of the online display.
These names have to be added to the `smasch_taxon_ids` file or added to one of these with the corrected spelling in the second column before the names can be used online.

From looking through the archive, the original file name for `alter_names.txt` was `riv_alter_names`.
The original file name for `mosses.txt` was `riv_non_vasc`.  Some variants of all of these files have the .txt file suffix or are without a file type suffix.

The original files were not alphabetically arranged, making finding name variants tedious. 
The uploaded files in this archive are sorted alphabetically by line.  New records are added alphabetically.

At some point, names from a file from Davis, one from Riverside, and one from SEINet were combined into the single file `alter_names`.
These section headings were added and commented out.  In the archive these headings have been deleted.

Names from alter_names were extracted to make the initial version of the orthographic variant file.  Others from the ICPN have been added.
This file is manually updated by consulting Tropicos periodically.

The rejected names file is generated from a list in the ICPN.

## List of Files

### alter_names.txt

### DUPS_TAXON.txt

This file contains all of the erroneous and extraneous taxon records that have been removed from `smasch_taxon_ids.txt`.
When a duplicate or erroneous record is found, it is delted from smasch and added here.  
The bottom section are a set of duplicate names that still need to be resolved.  
They have yet to be added because the CCH, eFlora, or ICPN do not have a record for that name.
