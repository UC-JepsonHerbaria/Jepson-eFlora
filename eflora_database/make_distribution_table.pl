#dist_codes are a shorter hexidecimal representation of a 40-character binary vector
#the 40 character vector indicates the presence or absence of a taxon in a bioregion
#the first 35 represent the 35 lowest-rank bioregions; the last five are blank spots (always 0)
#refer to the print OUT to see what what bioregions each position represents
#get_all_dist.pl translates bioregion distribution strings into the binary vector and packs it into hex
#here we unpack the hex so we can store the binary vector values in a table
#the table is used by the online "checklist builder" pages

#David called these dist_codes.txt  and Dick called them hcodes.txt
