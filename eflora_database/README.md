Table of illustrations and eflora accepted names: IJM_toc.html
Apparently maintained manually, not been updated for a number of years
Used by make_illustration_table.pl
name_illus_pairs is an (ongoing) updated version of that file with the following changes:
-it links to the actual image file names (.png extension)
-illustrations are linked to infras within a species
---e.g. an illustration for Planta alba has links added to P. alba var. alba, P. alba var. rubra etc.
-names are updated as they are changed in eflora
---e.g. Dodecatheons were changed to Primula. We will make these updates in the text file and on the actual image files




Notes from 2012, by Dick Moe
All the work stuff is in working_dir
but the canonical files are the JeffG_completed.txt file in the JepsImages directory
and the name_illus_pairs.txt file in the DATA directory

not_in_eflora.txt contains names from the illustrations that are not terminal taxa in the eflora.
The main causes are that either there is an illu of a species but we recognize multiple infras
Or there has been a name change since TJM2
These changes have yet to be made in name_illus_pairs.txt


JeffG_completed.txt is canonical as to what appears on the illustration caption (i.e. sensu TJM2)
-this links to the text file names from the OCR (.txt extension)
