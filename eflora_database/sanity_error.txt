known false positive (dash in Phytoneruron online volume no.), probable en-dash error5: NOTE: Based on molecular evidence, non-rosette terrestrial members of Primulaceae as treated in TJM (1993) removed to Myrsinaceae. Based on phylogenetic research, all California members of Myrsinaceae have been transferred to <I>Lysimachia</I> (Manns & Anderberg 2009 Willdenowia 39:49--54 and Cholewa 2014 Phytoneuron 2014-28: 1--2), as reflected in this revised treatment.
known false positive (dash in Phytoneruron online volume no.), probable en-dash error5: UNABRIDGED NOTE: Recent molecular work has redefined Ericales. Non-rosette, terrestrial members of Primulaceae s.l. are now widely treated in Myrsinoideae or Myrsinaceae, which are further characterized by synapomorphies of dark dots or streaks on stems, leaves, or flowers, short corolla tubes, seeds immersed in the placenta, and -- for woody members -- wood lacking rays or with only multiseriate rays. Primulaceae, Myrsinaceae, Theophrastaceae, and Maesaceae (a recent segregate of tropical trees) constitute a closely related, monophyletic group. <I>Lysimachia</I> has been recognized (even by Linnaeus) as a rather complex group with close affinities to other genera (<I>Glaux</I>, for instance, has been shown to be an apetalous sp. of <I>Lysimachia</I>). Phylogenetic research (by Arne A. Anderberg and colleagues in Europe) on this and related genera indicated that they were actually specialized taxa that had evolved within <I>Lysimachia</I>, so that all California members of Myrsinaceae now have been transferred to <I>Lysimachia</I> (Manns & Anderberg 2009 Willdenowia 39:49--54 and Cholewa 2014 Phytoneuron 2014-28: 1--2), as reflected in this revised treatment that now includes <I>Lysimachia arvensis</I>, <I>Lysimachia europaea</I>, <I>Lysimachia latifolia</I>, <I>Lysimachia maritima</I>, <I>Lysimachia minima</I>, and <I>Lysimachia monelli</I>, in addition to the two species previously treated in the genus.

Justice (1995, 2002) reports that the character is commonly variable within populations, and the samaras even vary within some specimens; for instance, E. Carter 693 (CAS) from Trinity Co. has some fruit with parallel or connivent wings, while other fruit on the same specimen has wings diverging by angles up to 60&deg;. Since the fruit character is not correlated with any other characters and may be variable within populations or even on a single tree, Justice is surely correct in denying taxonomic status to var. <I>greenei</I>.

Keller, reported as endemic to the Inyo Mountains and the eastern side of southern SN but plants with such fruit also occur in KR. Murray (Kalmia 7:1--20. 1976) and Shevock (TJM (1993)) reported that this var. has leaves like those of the so-called var. <I>torreyi</I> [var. <I>glabrum</I> sensu lato, see below], but in fact, this achene form is found on plants with the small, obtuse, few-toothed leaves of var. <I>diffusus</I> and on plants with the large, acute, many-toothed leaves of var. <I>glabrum</I> s. l. Justice (1995, 2002) reports that the character is commonly variable within populations, and the samaras even vary within some specimens; for instance, E. Carter 693 (CAS) from Trinity Co. has some fruit with parallel or connivent wings, while other fruit on the same specimen has wings diverging by angles up to 60&deg;. Since the fruit character is not correlated with any other characters and may be variable within populations or even on a single tree, Justice is surely correct in denying taxonomic status to var. <I>greenei</I>. : 90 tag=UNABRIDGED NOTE last tag=UNABRIDGED NOTE 8968
