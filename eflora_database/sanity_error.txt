known false positive (dash in Phytoneruron online volume no.), probable en-dash error5: UNABRIDGED NOTE: Recent molecular work has redefined Ericales. Non-rosette, terrestrial members of Primulaceae s.l. are now widely treated in Myrsinoideae or Myrsinaceae, which are further characterized by synapomorphies of dark dots or streaks on stems, leaves, or flowers, short corolla tubes, seeds immersed in the placenta, and -- for woody members -- wood lacking rays or with only multiseriate rays. Primulaceae, Myrsinaceae, Theophrastaceae, and Maesaceae (a recent segregate of tropical trees) constitute a closely related, monophyletic group. <I>Lysimachia</I> has been recognized (even by Linnaeus) as a rather complex group with close affinities to other genera (<I>Glaux</I>, for instance, has been shown to be an apetalous sp. of <I>Lysimachia</I>). Phylogenetic research (by Arne A. Anderberg and colleagues in Europe) on this and related genera indicated that they were actually specialized taxa that had evolved within <I>Lysimachia</I>, so that all California members of Myrsinaceae now have been transferred to <I>Lysimachia</I> (Manns & Anderberg 2009 Willdenowia 39:49--54 and Cholewa 2014 Phytoneuron 2014-28: 1--2), as reflected in this revised treatment that now includes <I>Lysimachia arvensis</I>, <I>Lysimachia europaea</I>, <I>Lysimachia latifolia</I>, <I>Lysimachia maritima</I>, <I>Lysimachia minima</I>, and <I>Lysimachia monelli</I>, in addition to the two species previously treated in the genus.
