known false positive (dash in Phytoneruron online volume no.), probable en-dash error5: UNABRIDGED NOTE: Recent molecular work has redefined Ericales. Non-rosette, terrestrial members of Primulaceae s.l. are now widely treated in Myrsinoideae or Myrsinaceae, which are further characterized by synapomorphies of dark dots or streaks on stems, leaves, or flowers, short corolla tubes, seeds immersed in the placenta, and -- for woody members -- wood lacking rays or with only multiseriate rays. Primulaceae, Myrsinaceae, Theophrastaceae, and Maesaceae (a recent segregate of tropical trees) constitute a closely related, monophyletic group. <I>Lysimachia</I> has been recognized (even by Linnaeus) as a rather complex group with close affinities to other genera (<I>Glaux</I>, for instance, has been shown to be an apetalous sp. of <I>Lysimachia</I>). Phylogenetic research (by Arne A. Anderberg and colleagues in Europe) on this and related genera indicated that they were actually specialized taxa that had evolved within <I>Lysimachia</I>, so that all California members of Myrsinaceae now have been transferred to <I>Lysimachia</I> (Manns & Anderberg 2009 Willdenowia 39:49--54 and Cholewa 2014 Phytoneuron 2014-28: 1--2), as reflected in this revised treatment that now includes <I>Lysimachia arvensis</I>, <I>Lysimachia europaea</I>, <I>Lysimachia latifolia</I>, <I>Lysimachia maritima</I>, <I>Lysimachia minima</I>, and <I>Lysimachia monelli</I>, in addition to the two species previously treated in the genus.

eflora_treatments.txt - possible UNABRIDGED KEY LEAD tag missing4: UNABRIDGED NOTE: <I>Acer glabrum</I> is a very variable sp., but the pattern of variation is confusing. The species has been divided into as many as six varieties, but most of the variation probably results from local selection and clinal variation, not divergence that can be recognized taxonomically. Justice (1995, 2002) follows some earlier authors in restricting the name <I>Acer glabrum</I> var. <I>glabrum</I> to Rocky Mountain populations, and separating populations from California and southern Oregon as var. <I>torreyi</I> (Greene) Smiley based on supposed differences in the venation and form of the lobe apex and marginal teeth (var. <I>glabrum</I> with leaf lobes and marginal teeth acute, and fine venation clearly visible and forming regular areoles, and var. <I>torreyi</I> with leaf lobes and marginal teeth usually broad and apically rounded, and fine venation "somewhat obscured" and less regular). I find these characters more variable in both regions than Justice's accounts suggest. There are no constant differences between plants from the two regions, however. Plants from around the type locality in Colorado tend to have short-acuminate lobes and long, sharply acute teeth, but some California specimens approach this morphology (especially from the Klamath region), and California specimens with acute teeth and lobes are fairly common (especially in the Klamath region). Plants from Wyoming, Utah, southeastern Idaho and southernmost Montana generally have blunt teeth and lobes, and are generally indistinguishable from California specimens. Given the variability of these characters and the absence of consistent differences between the named taxa, I see no valid basis for excluding California plants from var. <I>glabrum</I>. Some older references key all plants with compound leaves to var. <I>neomexicanum</I> (Greene) Kearney & Peebles. Compound leaves do occur rarely in California, but these plants are not referable to var. <I>neomexicanum</I> which is found in CO, New Mexico. Justice (1995, 2002) gives characters that define the variety adequately. <I>Acer glabrum</I> var. <I>douglasii</I> (Hook.) Dippel is found from northern and eastern Oregon, southern Idaho, south-central Montana north to southern Alaska. This variety has been reported for California, but all specimens seen named as var. <I>douglasii</I> from southern of Lane County, Oregon have been misidentified. <I>Acer glabrum</I> var. <I>douglasii</I> differs from our California plants as follows:<br />1. Middle lobe of leaf triangular or triangular-ovate, widest at (or near?) base, strongly slender-acuminate, with many sharp teeth .....-> var. douglasii;<br />1' Middle lobe of leaf ovate, oblong, rhombic, or obovate, broadened well above its base; apices obtuse, acute, or short-acuminate; teeth few to many, blunt to sharp .....-> varieties <I>diffusum</I> and <I>glabrum</I>;<br />If recognized taxonomically, plants with mericarp wings overlapping assignable to var. <I>greenei</I> A.C. Keller, reported as endemic to the Inyo Mountains and the eastern side of southern SN but plants with such fruit also occur in KR. Murray (Kalmia 7:1--20. 1976) and Shevock (TJM (1993)) reported that this var. has leaves like those of the so-called var. <I>torreyi</I> [var. <I>glabrum</I> sensu lato, see below], but in fact, this achene form is found on plants with the small, obtuse, few-toothed leaves of var. <I>diffusus</I> and on plants with the large, acute, many-toothed leaves of var. <I>glabrum</I> s. l. Justice (1995, 2002) reports that the character is commonly variable within populations, and the samaras even vary within some specimens; for instance, E. Carter 693 (CAS) from Trinity Co. has some fruit with parallel or connivent wings, while other fruit on the same specimen has wings diverging by angles up to 60&deg;. Since the fruit character is not correlated with any other characters and may be variable within populations or even on a single tree, Justice is surely correct in denying taxonomic status to var. <I>greenei</I>.
